**Metrics Summary**  
Overall, the objective metrics also confirm my influential, positive leadership in economics in general and especially within the field of efficiency and productivity analysis (one of key strengths of UQ School of Economics). For example, [Google Metrics](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KBGcuJEAAAAJ&hl=en) (as of 1 May 2024):  
  ![][image1]  ![A graph of a number of barsDescription automatically generated][image2]

This level of citations is usually considered as very high for economists (in top 2-5% by various aspects). For example, an overall indication of my contribution to research could be inferred from the REPEC rankings, which is the most comprehensive and well-recognized ranking in economics, based on transparent and sophisticated methodology applied to most of the population of economists in the world, accounting for both **quantity** and **quality** of their publications and both quantity and quality of their citations (weighting each publication and its citations by the quality of journals within all economics). In particular, REPEC ranks my research contribution as high as it is for many distinguished professors across the World, e.g. as of April 2024:

* [in top 5% in the World overall](https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html)  

* [in top 2% in the World, in the last 10 years of research](https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all10.html), i.e., similar rank as  [Ariel Pakes](https://ideas.repec.org/e/ppa20.html) (Harvard), [John H. Cochrane](https://ideas.repec.org/e/pco57.html) (Stanford),  [Michael P Keane](https://ideas.repec.org/e/pke18.html) (UNSW), [Jiti Gao](https://ideas.repec.org/f/pga362.html) (Monash),  [Antoinette Schoar](https://ideas.repec.org/e/psc180.html) (MIT), etc.

* [in top 4% (in top 56\) economists in Australia](https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.australia.html) overall and [in top 2% (in top 29\) economists in Australia](https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.australia.html) in the last 10 years of research  

* [in top 2% (in top 23\) in the World for the field of Efficiency & Productivity](https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.eff.html) (e.g., similar rank in this field as [Daron Acemoglu](https://ideas.repec.org/e/pac16.html) (MIT), [Bronwyn Hughes Hall](https://ideas.repec.org/e/pha54.html) (UC Berkley), [Marc J. Melitz](https://ideas.repec.org/f/pme260.html) (Harvard), [David E. Card](https://ideas.repec.org/f/pca271.html) (UC Berkley), [Erik Brynjolfsson](https://ideas.repec.org/e/pbr87.html) (Stanford), etc.

**APPENDIX**

**Remarks on Quality of Journals based on various Objective Scientometric Facts**

***Operations Research*** (3 publications) besides being A\* in ABDC2013 ranking, it is the very best journal in the field of operations research and mathematics for business analysis. Along with very few journals from each field (e.g., *AER, Annals of Statistics, Econometrica, JASA, Management Science*, etc.) it consistently stays in the league of the very best journals in the world, according to many rankings (e.g., see ranking of ABS). This journal is in the list of Financial Times top 50 journals.

***European Journal of Operational Research*** or EJOR (10+ publications) is usually considered as one of two best journals that fully specialize on Operations Research (along with the Operations Research journal), and includes the field of productivity and efficiency analysis as one of areas. It is also worth noting that one of the most important papers in the area of efficiency and productivity analysis, by Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (1978, over 23,000 citations in Google), was also published in EJOR, as many other major papers in the area.  The following facts might also be useful to consider:

* It is ranked as A\* according to ABDC2013.  
* Comparison based on up-to-date impact factors against such very top journals in the field as *Management Science* and *Operations Research* reveals that EJOR has very similar impact factor and very similar h-index as them.   
* A comprehensive analysis in Holsapple and Lee-Post (2010, [doi:10.1016/j.omega.2009.08.002](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.omega.2009.08.002)) concludes that:   
1) EJOR is **ranked 1st** among 22 journals in the field of Operations Management (including *Management Science* and *Operations Research*) based on breadth scores;   
2) EJOR is **ranked 3rd** (just below *Management Science* and *Operations Research*) on intensity scores in a larger peer group of 26 journals.   
* Google Scholar has ranked EJOR as among the top 3 publications in Operations Research (as of 20/11/2017 it was ranked in **top 2**)

I am a Professor of Economics at The University of Queensland, specialising in econometrics, productivity and efficiency analysis, and performance measurement. I am an elected member of the Conference on Research in Income and Wealth (CRIW) of the National Bureau of Economic Research and a former ARC Future Fellow (2017–2022). My research has been published in leading journals including Operations Research, Journal of Econometrics, Journal of Applied Econometrics, European Journal of Operational Research, and Econometric Reviews, and I have co-authored major books with Cambridge University Press. I am actively engaged in policy-relevant research, including work for the Australian Energy Regulator, the Asian Productivity Organization, and Australia's Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, and currently serve as President of the International Society for Efficiency and Productivity Analysis (ISEAPA).

## Short Biography

I am a Professor of Economics at the School of Economics, **The University of Queensland (UQ)**, Australia ([https://economics.uq.edu.au](https://economics.uq.edu.au)). I am an **elected member of the Conference on Research in Income and Wealth (CRIW)** of the **National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)** ([https://www.nber.org/CRIW](https://www.nber.org/CRIW)). 

Previously, I was an **ARC Future Fellow** (2017–2022), served as **Director of UQ's Centre for Efficiency and Productivity Analysis (CEPA)** from 2015 to 2018  
(https://economics.uq.edu.au/centre-efficiency-and-productivity-analysis), and represented Level E faculty on the School's Executive Committee from 2021 to 2023\. I began my academic career as an Assistant Professor in 2002 at the **EERC–Kyiv**, later renamed the **Kyiv School of Economics** ([https://kse.ua](https://kse.ua)).

My research focuses on **econometrics**, with particular emphasis on **productivity and efficiency analysis** and **performance measurement**, spanning theory, methodology, and policy-relevant applications. My work develops and advances both **parametric and non-parametric methods**—including **data envelopment analysis (DEA)**, **stochastic frontier analysis (SFA)**, and **productivity index theory**—and applies them across a wide range of settings, including healthcare, banking, energy, and macroeconomic growth.

I have published extensively in leading journals in economics, econometrics, and operations research, including *Operations Research*  
([https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/opre](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/opre)), *Journal of Econometrics*  
([https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-econometrics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-econometrics)), *Journal of Applied Econometrics*  
([https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10991255](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10991255)), *European Journal of Operational Research*  
([https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/european-journal-of-operational-research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/european-journal-of-operational-research)), and *Econometric Reviews*  
([https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/lecr20/current](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/lecr20/current)), among others.

Together with **Robin Sickles** (Rice University), I am a co-author of the book *Measurement of Productivity and Efficiency: Theory and Practice* (Cambridge University Press, 2019):  
[https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/measurement-of-productivity-and-efficiency/](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/measurement-of-productivity-and-efficiency/) 

I am also a co-author, with **Shawna Grosskopf** and **Vivian Valdmanis**, of *The Cambridge Handbook of Productivity, Efficiency & Effectiveness in Health Care* (Cambridge University Press, 2024):  
[https://www.cambridge.org/core/handbooks/cambridge-handbook-of-productivity-efficiency-and-effectiveness-in-health-care/](https://www.cambridge.org/core/handbooks/cambridge-handbook-of-productivity-efficiency-and-effectiveness-in-health-care/) 

Alongside research and policy engagement, I am deeply involved in **professional service and leadership**. I currently serve as **President of the International Society for Efficiency and Productivity Analysis (ISEAPA)** ([https://iseapa.org](https://iseapa.org)), where I also was a **co-founding director** (together with Robin Sickles and William Greene). 

I have held editorial roles for several leading journals in the field, most notably the *Journal of Productivity Analysis* ([https://link.springer.com/journal/11123](https://link.springer.com/journal/11123)). I place strong emphasis on **mentoring early-career researchers** and on building **international research communities** through conferences, collaborative projects, and scholarly networks.

Beyond academia, I have been actively engaged in **policy-impact research and advisory work**, including projects for the 

- **Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety** in Australia ([https://agedcare.royalcommission.gov.au](https://agedcare.royalcommission.gov.au)), 

- the **Asian Productivity Organization** ([https://www.apo-tokyo.org](https://www.apo-tokyo.org)), 

- the **Australian Energy Regulator** ([https://www.aer.gov.au](https://www.aer.gov.au)), 

- the **Port of Brisbane** ([https://www.portbris.com.au](https://www.portbris.com.au)), etc. 

I have also delivered policy-focused lectures and seminars at institutions such as the **International Monetary Fund** ([https://www.imf.org](https://www.imf.org)), the **Reserve Bank of Australia**  
([https://www.rba.gov.au](https://www.rba.gov.au)), the **Reserve Bank of New Zealand** ([https://www.rbnz.govt.nz](https://www.rbnz.govt.nz)), and the **New Zealand Treasury** ([https://www.treasury.govt.nz](https://www.treasury.govt.nz)), etc.

I started at the School of Economics of The University of Queensland as an Associate Professor in 2010. I served at different roles, including as Director of UQ's Centre for Efficiency and Productivity Analysis (CEPA), from 2015 to 2018 (https://economics.uq.edu.au/centre-efficiency-and-productivity-analysis), and represented Level E faculty on the School's Executive Committee from 2021 to 2023, etc. I began my academic career as an Assistant Professor at the EERC–Kyiv, later renamed the Kyiv School of Economics (https://kse.ua). 

From 2017 till 2022, I was an ARC Future Fellow at UQ, and promoted to Professor in 2020.
